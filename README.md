# unist_software_engineering

For group project CSE 364, Software Programming

## 1. Project description

### Workflow

The way of using github is same as prior milestones. We made issues and branches of some topics and 
Pull Requests to repository before merge it. We separated the project to two teams;team1 for part1 & 
part2 and team2 for unit test. After making the part1 and part2, team2 reviews that and edit to proper way.
Then, team2 makes unit test and team1 write input error handling and README.md file.
Each teams reviews other teams' outcomes.

### Brief explanation of recommendation algorithm

The basic concept is, finds the users who rated high score for the entered movie, then
recommends the movies that the selected users watched a lot and rated well.    

In `LoadMovieTitle.java`, creates a userList of users who rated the input movie at least 3 points. 
With that userList, in `MovieTitleRecommend.java`, find movies what the selected users rated more than
3 points and record the number of rating for each movie. At this point, weights are applied using 
similarities in genres, the more genres that match, the more weights. Then rank the records to generate movieList
of limit*2 sizes(`ArrayList<Integer> topDoubleLimit`).    
After that, rank the selected movies by average rating to create a final movieList that size of limit.    
If the size of final movieList is smaller than limit(when movie has very rare genre), it adds other movies with high 
views and ratings to the back until limit.


## 2. How to run program?

### Environments

- ubuntu 20.04
- VIM - Vi IMproved 8.1
- git version 2.25.1
- openjdk 11.0.10
- Apache Maven 3.6.3

### Install and Execute

```
git clone https://github.com/samsara-ku/unist_software_engineering.git
cd unist_software_engineering
mvn install
java -cp target/cse364-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.Main "F" "25" "Gradstudent"
java -cp target/cse364-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.Main "F" "25" "Gradstudent" "Drama"
```

## 3. Roles of each member

## 4. Expected output

#### The best top 10 recommanded movies in the given user information and given movie genres

```
java -cp target/cse364-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.Main "gender" "age" "occupation" "genres"
1. %s (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt%s) : %d watched and got %.2f ratings.
2. %s (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt%s) : %d watched and got %.2f ratings.
...
10. %s (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt%s) : %d watched and got %.2f ratings.
```

### Input error handling

This explains only milestone2 error handling. Error handling of milestone 1 is also contained in the code.

1. If the number of arguments are wrong, print "The number of arguments is not appropriate. Please use 2, 3, or 4 parameters. (Categories, Occupation | Gender, Age, Occupation | Gender, Age, Occupation, Genre)".
   `ex.) com.Main "adventure"`
2. If input gender is wrong, print "Wrong gender input. Please try again with F for female or M for male."
   `ex.) com.Main "Female" "25" "Gradstudent"`
3. If the input age is non-positive, print "Wrong age input. (Non-positive age) Please try again with appropriate age."
   `ex.) com.Main "F" "0" "Gradstudent"`
4. If the input age is not integer, print "Wrong age input. (Not an integer) Please try again with appropriate age."
   `ex.) com.Main "F" "Ten" "Gradstudent"`
5. If the input occupation is not in the occupation list, print "Can't search because it's an inappropriate occupation. Please try again with appropriate occupation."
   `ex.) com.Main "F" "25" "Gradstu"`
6. If the input genre is not in the genre list, print "Can't search because there is inappropriate category. Please try again with appropriate category."
   `ex.) com.Main "F" "25" "Gradstudent" "com"`
